# Title :
Marvellous comics: mirror of society
# Abstract
Superheroes and villains in comics can have a real impact on society. They’re supposed to represent what’s good and bad. Thus, the way the character is portrayed will have an influence on the reader. If for example all villains are part of the same minority, people will unconsciously see them in real life as bad people. Moreover, a character like Tony Stark could inspire people to study engineering. And these are just examples to illustrate the power comics can have on us.
We can thus study this choice of characters, how diverse it is, and if there is a tendency towards a specific portrait for superheroes and villains.

# Questions for TAa
- How to scrape on different web pages (for example on one page, we have the names of different characters and each one has a specific page.)
- Is it possible to plot data in a really fancy way (custom histogram with characters instead of bars) ?
